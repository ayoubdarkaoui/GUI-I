                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Ayoub Darkaoui</strong> and this is my first web page <strong><u>EVER!</u></strong>
                    How exciting! 
                    I'm a Computer Science student at UML and I plan 
                    to graduate by the end of the next academic year. 
                    I am very passionate about programming and software development, 
                    and I feel excited to enroll in this Course sequence, because I 
                    believe it will help me a great deal in fostering and honing my 
                    skills in full stack development and engineering. 
                    I am father of a three year old son named <a href="images/IMG_7966.png"> <strong>Sanad</strong></a> , 
                    and he keeps me busy, active, and happy. He's pretty much all the leisure time I
                    have. However, I enjoy watching soccer, listening to podcasts and
                    audiobooks, and hiking. 
                </p>
                <p>This website is created as part of a project sequence for
                    the GUI Programming I course at UMass Lowell. Thanks for
                    checking out my website!
                </p>
