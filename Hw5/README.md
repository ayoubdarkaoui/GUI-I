## Assignment details: 

This web application attempts to implement a one line Scrabble Board Game. 
The web app is not fully functional given the constraint of time, but there 
are many aspects of the code that works properly. This is the details of the
web page features: 

#### Drag: 
The user can drag the tiles from the rack and request new tiles as needed. 

#### Drop: 
The user can drop the tiles on the board spots provided. 

#### Move: 
The user is able to move the letters after they are dropped, but that makes 
the outcome word a little awkward. 

#### Score: 
The code is able to count scores of letters whne they are dropped on double 
letter and double word scores. 
If the world is valid, it is then recorded and score is stored in total score. 

#### Dictionary Validation: 
I used the Free Dictionary API https://dictionaryapi.dev/ and it works properly. 

#### Tables: 
I added 2 tables to my web page; one that stores all the words submitted, whether 
they are valid or not, and the score for each submitted word. The other table
keeps track of the number of valid and invalid words, as well as the total 
score for only the valid words. 

### Limitations: 
I was not able to make my application implement the moving of tiles and update
the words dynamically. 
I was also unable to implement an exception handling mechanism.
